## Tutoring Statistics Visualization

**Visualization:** [`Click here`](https://datastudio.google.com/reporting/2004c153-b0d4-42e1-8bee-1f3c6eaa2fa8)

**Note:** The dataset was modified in order to protect the privacy of the tutors and students.


**Description:** Condensing all weekly CSV files from tutoring into a database and use it to feed the dashboard.

**Business Problem:** Because the administrator in charge to maintain the booking systems at the university left, nobody was in charge to maintain it. The database would break by itsel on days where a lot of web traffics happen. In order to prevent a disaster, the tutoring director decided to save the information of the booking appointments every week resulting in many CSV files. When there is a need to know something about tutoring, how many students came, what class was requested the most, etc, the director had to merge all the CSV files taking a lot of time just to get an answer. In order to reduce the time, I decided to condense all the CSV files into a database. In this case, I used free softwares to do that due to this being something that I purely wanted to do...not that I was required. Therefore, I chose the Google Analytics pack as the tools and used BigQuery to centralize all the booking informations and use DataStudio (Looker Studio) to provide visibility. Throughout my time working as a Graduate Assistant, I updated weekly the database once I was able to get to the CSV file.
