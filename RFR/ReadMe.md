**Description:** The RFR program works with Chartwells Dining Service on campus to recover unused food from the dining halls and retail locations on campus and donate the recovered food to local non-profit organizations in the Fayetteville Area. By tracking the amount of food waste generated by various dining halls and food types and communicating this information to Chartwells, RFR aim to reduce food waste at the source while alleviating food insecurity in the community. By utilizing and manipulating this data, RFR and Chartwells hope to find significant results, which will improve the inventory forecasting accuracy and food preparation for the Chartwells Organization.

**Challenges:**
  + **Messy data:** 19,000+ rows of transactions which around 18,000 are similar type with different wordings. For example: <br>
    - Row 1 - chicken with pasta <br> 
    - Row 2 - pasta with chicken
  + **Inconsistent recollection of data:** They gather the information through a Google form. However, the selections are typed leading into data inconsistensy.
  + **Inconsistent gathering:** They do not have a specific time to gather and recover food due to lack of volunteers.

  
  **Resolve:** I am going to provide solution to the first two main points.
  
  ### PROCEDURE ###
  
  **Dataset At First Glance:**

As you can see on row 59 and 60 they are basically the same, however, because different volunteers type differently, it may have slight difference in the information entered (the same between vegetables and vetagatables row 73 and 74). You can see this issue in the 19,000+ rows of transactions due to not having a standard or rules when inputting the information.

**Data Cleansing**

I used two ways to cleanse the dataset and I worked by block. By that I mean I categorized them by food group then worked on standardizing the food names based on the food group. I some part I used Excel to create the food category and some part I used SAS EG to do the big bulk of cleansing. <br>

Cleansing and formatting was the toughest part of the project. Once I was done with this, the rest was a walk in the park.

**Exploratory Analysis**

Once I knew that the formatting was good and everything was clean, I played around to see if what I did made sense. Afterwards, it was time to move to the second business problem which was to standardize their data collection.

**Data Standardization**

Since RFR works with volunteers and they prefer using Google form, I thought of using it as the database to get live visualization as soon as they input the information. In order to do that, I asked them for their Google form, and I revamped that using multiple choices to avoid typos and duplicates. Because Google form cannot be a database, I connected the Google sheets file that collect the information from the form to connect to Google DataStudio and added the cleaned dataset on it.

**How Does It Work?**

Once the volunteer inputs the information in the Google form, it will be capture in the sheets combining it with the cleaned dataset.

**Result**

The result is that once a form is introduced, it will be shown in the dashboard. Cleaning the dataset and standardizing the way the data is captured will make it easier for RFR spend their time to analyze the trends instead of spending time cleansing.
